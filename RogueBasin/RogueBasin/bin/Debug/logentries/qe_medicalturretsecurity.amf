The medical level is locked down and we
can't get out. <lastname> told me that
saw a lot of suspicious activity going
on near the security centre. We think
the override keycard is there but it
could be dangerous - they're building
something in there.

<lastname> claims there ought to be
something that can help stashed on this
level. He's gone out to look but he's
been gone for too long.

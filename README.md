This repository contains the sources for my roguelike games:

* DDRogue
* PrincessRL
* TraumaRL
* FlatlineRL
* RoyaleRL

See http://flend.net for details of these games.

The source code is covered by the GPL-v3 (see LICENSE)

The graphics (where applicable) are proprietary and may not be used in other projects without my permission.

The different games are in different branches:

* ddrogue
* princessrl
* flatlinerl
* traumarl

master tracks my current project: trauma2

All these branches build with the latest VC# Express 2013.

These are code-jam games so don't expect the code to be very pretty :)
